# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

- This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension
- `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your language support and define
the location of the grammar file that has been copied into your extension.
- `syntaxes/pddl.tmLanguage.json` - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization
- `language-configuration.json` - this the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for
comments and brackets.

## Get up and running straight away

- run `npm install` and `npm run compile` commands first
- press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded (Or launch "Launch client" from the debug window)
- create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language
- verify that syntax highlight works and that the language configuration settings are working

## Make changes

- you can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above
- you can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes

## Install your extension

- To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code. Use the `deploy.cmd` on Windows.
- To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.
